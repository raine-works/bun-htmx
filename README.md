# Bun HTMX demo

## Get started

### Setup

I've added a devcontainer config. If you are using vscode simply use the remote development extension to re-open in a container. (You must have docker to use this feature)

Run the following commands.

`bun install` - will install dependencies

`bun setup` - will create a .env file

### Start the development server

`bun dev`
